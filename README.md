# NCAA-Positional-Battle

## Project Background
With the emergence of smaller-sized athletes, such as Stephen Curry, Kyrie Irving, and Damian Lillard, etc., it's very noticeable that the Guard position has significantly risen in popularity. 

This leads to the question; did Guards become better and more popular than the previous most sought-after position, Center?
Specifically, has it been evident in the NCAA and its winners of the NCAA Tournament MVP and the Season MVP from 1975?

The NCAA contains most of the players that enter the NBA and is often the first place where the trend begins to appear.
This project thoroughly analyzes and synthesizes this data to determine the trend's accuracy

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:
- **Efficiency of Scoring**: Evaluation of the efficiency of scoring in all areas for all positions.
- **Physical Difference**: An analysis of the Height spread throughout the league's MVPs.
- **Season Stats**: An assessment and comparison of the season stats between all positions.


## Basic Information
This project is self-driven and was not done with any professional intervention.

All of the data was obtained through [SRCBB](https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/) by searching up the respective names of the players.
All data was first gathered through Google Sheets manually and then went through an initial phase of cleaning.

After this, the data was downloaded onto Jupyter Notebook which went through another layer of data cleaning and data preparation.
When the data was finally deemed ready, it was used to analyze and then create visualizations.
