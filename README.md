# NCAA-Positional-Battle
With the emergence of smaller-sized athletes, such as Stephen Curry, Kyrie Irving, and Damian Lillard, etc., it's very noticeable that the Guard position has significantly risen in popularity. This leads to the question; did Guards become better and more popular than the previous most sought-after position, Center?
Specifically, I focused on the NCAA and its winners of the NCAA Tournament MVP and the Season MVP from 1975.
I tried to analyze the change of the trend of the winners along with their stats to figure out the reason.


## Basic Information
This project is self-driven and was not done with any professional intervention.
All of the data was obtained through [SRCBB](https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/) by searching up the respective names of the players.
All data was first gathered through Google Sheets manually and then went through an initial phase of cleaning.
After this, the data was downloaded onto Jupyter Notebook which went through another layer of data cleaning and data preparation.
When the data was finally deemed ready, I used it to analyze and then create visualizations.
I also used Tableau at the end to finally create a Dashboard for an easier viewing of the results.
